# A Little Markdown Story
There once was a girl, a very *very* simple girl, who wanted to learn how to use a new language called **Markdown**.
~~She was not very good.~~
## But she wanted to get better!
So eventually she may:
1. Impress all her friends
2. Get a boyfriend

Preferably a nerdy one.

3. Thats it.

### The End
